        Embarking on an exhilarating journey in computer science at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, I'm eagerly anticipating how my skills will align with industry standards. Continuously enhancing my abilities and deepening my understanding of the field, I've found solace in the art of hacking. I diligently practice Fedora-based Linux scripts, utilize Burp Suites, and delve myself into OSINT techniques.
